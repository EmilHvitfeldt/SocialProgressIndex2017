Social Progress Index 2017 dataviz
==================================

This repository stores the code for my Social Progress Index 2017 data-viz shiny application.

It can be found at the following [link](http://emilhvitfeldt.shinyapps.io/social_progress_index_2017_dataviz).

The goal of Social Progress Index 2017 data-viz is to address a problem I found in the [2017 Social Progress Index](http://www.socialprogressindex.com/) which was that I wasn't able to compare multiple countries within each category. E.i. I could see that Finland was ranked 4 in Deaths from infectious diseases, but I was unable to easily see which country came 1, 2 or 100th. This shiny application tries to accomplish that goal.
